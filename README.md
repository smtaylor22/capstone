# Benedict Option
## A communal-liturgical prayer app

### General Info
This is the source code for my Computer Science Senior Capstone project at Sattler College.

I built the app using the Python Django web framework. 

The front end I designed with JavaScript and Bootstrap.

The project is hosted on Heroku at, 
https://benedict-option.herokuapp.com/

Here is a video walkthrough of how to use the app. I also briefly walk through the code structure to give you an idea of how I built this.

### Project Code Organization
Most of the app functionality is found in the directory named /benedict_option. There you will find a file called views.py. Most of the apps
main backend functionality is in there. Models.py defines the structure for the database and the kinds of data objects the app works with. 

Most of the front end HTML functionality is all found in the directory named /templates. You will find several HTML files for my web app. Index.html is the main one.

The directory /static hosts all the Javascript functionality. Script.js runs all the features for the front end and Countdown.js defines the timer functionality. 

### Project Inspiration
During my time at Sattler, I came across the book, Benedict Option by Rod Dreher. One of the key points he makes in the book is how Christians need to build strong communities rooted in prayer and scripture to survive the evils coming against the Christians. One of the practices that Rod Dreher recommends to create this is liturgical prayer. He emphasizes how important it is to take time out of our busy schedules to gather with fellow Christians to pray together. He also emphasizes how these liturgies are meant to help us form a way of life that follows Christ. And Christian liturgies also help foster community.  Historically liturgies have always meant to be practiced in a communal context. This inspired me to use my computer science skills to figure out a way to help build this. 

### Project Design Goals
I designed this project for my senior Capstone project at Sattler College. I wanted to design an app that would help foster a community of liturgical prayer for people unable to be together physically. The major differentiating feature from other prayer and social apps is how it allows users to easily join a video chat room and pray through a liturgy on the app. As I mentioned I really believe in the importance of community in our discipleship. The video feature aims to achieve that through praying liturgies together. The app is intended to help people foster a deeper desire for prayer, discover and engage with quality liturgical prayers, and to build a community around prayer. Based on what I have learned about discipline and habits, I have also designed it to help people foster more discipline and routine in their prayers. Liturgical prayers help people build a habit of turning their minds back to God during a busy day. 

### Project Impact
My hope is that my capstone project can contribute to the kingdom by helping others build strong communities through praying liturgies together. I started this project out of a deeper desire to develop a lifestyle of prayer and connection with God for myself. Part of my goal is to limit technologyâ€™s ability to distract us from God and instead use it to help us focus on Him. I hope that people can develop habits around praying these liturgies to shape them more into the image of Christ. Rather than engaging with the new liturgies that the current social networks teach them to live out which often teach consumerism and independence. I personally am worried about many of my generation may be turning more towards exciting but empty promises that shiny social apps offer instead of the abundant life promised to faithful Christians. My hope is that my app can help people discover that abundant life through praying liturgical prayers in the app.
