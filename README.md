# Benedict Option

### A communal-liturgical prayer app

This is the source code for my Computer Science Senior Capstone project at Sattler College.

I built the app using the Python Django web framework. 

The front end I designed with JavaScript and Bootstrap.

The project is hosted on Heroku at, 
https://benedict-option.herokuapp.com/

Most of the app functionality is found in the directory named /benedict_option. There you will find a file called views.py. Most of the apps
main backend functionality is in there. Models.py defines the structure for the database and the kinds of data objects the app works with. 

Most of the front end HTML functionality is all found in the directory named /templates. You will find several HTML files for my web app. Index.html is the main one.

The directory /static hosts all the Javascript functionality. Script.js runs all the features for the front end and Countdown.js defines the timer functionality.
